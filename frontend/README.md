# Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Run dev server

   npm run dev

3. Notes

- Vite is configured to proxy `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` so the frontend can call `/api/users/` during development.
- Tailwind is already configured; edit `src/index.css` to customize tokens.
